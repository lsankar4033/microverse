# How to play

## Testnet instructions

Thank you for testing the prototype of Microverse! The only thing you need to know in addition to what's below is that the game is on Ropsten. So you'll have to switch your network from Mainnet to Ropsten in Metamask. If you don't have Ropsten Ether, visit:

* https://faucet.ropsten.be/
* https://faucet.metamask.io/

And get 1 ETH from each. 

Please just play the game like a self-interested player (want to earn money, have fun). If you can break the game, that would be awesome. The player with the most winnings in the testnet round will get something special. 

## Game overview

Microverse is a simulated universe controlled by powerful aliens. The universe has many worlds that can be bought, sold, and powered. Owners of these worlds receive a cut of the Microverse economy. Worlds are always for sale, so ambitious Microverse-ians are always scheming for a big cut.

The aliens are happy if the Microverse economy grows, but if too much time passes between transactions in the world, they throw their hands up, dump a stimulus on the worlds that seem to be the most behind, and start the simulation over.

## The concept

There are two games to play and win in Microverse.

1. Owners of worlds receive a cut of the Microverse economy. The higher the price of your world, the larger cut of each Microverse transaction you get.
2. When a simulation ends, the lowest priced world in the universe receives a huge stimulus. Timing the end of the simulation just right and positioning your worlds to win the stimulus could help you win the jackpot.

## The rules

* Microverse contains 19 worlds
* Every world is always for sale
* At the start of the simulation, worlds are unowned, and are sold via dutch auction where the price slowly declines towards zero until the world is sold
* Owners can change the price of their worlds, but have to pay a 10% tax on the new price
* All transactions in Microverse go directly through the Microverse economy (see figure below for the exact splits), with roughly half going towards the stimulus (jackpot) and the other half going instantly to the owners of worlds
* As soon all worlds are sold, a the round begins and the round timer starts counting down from 4 hours
* Each time a world is purchased or the price is changed the timer is reset, starting with 4 hours and halving every 10 ETH that flow through the Microverse
* At the end of the simulation, the player who owns the lowest price world wins half of the stimulus. The rest is distributed proportionally rest of the worlds

### Microverse economy splits

Every ETH that flows through the Microverse economy is allocated as follows:

* 40% to the stimulus
* 38% to current owners of worlds
* 12% to developers
* 5% to the referrer
* 5% to seed the stimulus of the next simulation

### Stimulus splits

At the end of a simulation, 45% of the stimulus is sent directly to the owner of the world with the lowest price and 5% is sent to devs.

The remaining 50% is distributed as follows:
* 40% to the owners of worlds, sorted by lowest price
* 10% to seed the next round
