# How to play

## Game overview

Microverse is a simulated universe controlled by powerful aliens. The universe has many worlds that can be bought, sold, and powered. Owners of these worlds receive a cut of the Microverse economy. Worlds are always for sale, so ambitious Microverse-ians are always scheming for a big cut. 

The aliens are happy if the Microverse economy grows, but if too much time passes between transactions in the world, they throw their hands up, dump a stimulus on the worlds that seem to be the most behind, and start the simulation over. 

## The concept

There are two games to play and win in Microverse. 

1. Owners of worlds receive a cut of the Microverse economy. Acquiring and powering worlds to optimize your share can be very profitable as the simulation runs. 
2. When a simulation ends, the worlds that are least powerful relative to their neighbors receive a huge stimulus. Timing the end of the simulation just right and positioning your worlds to win the stimulus could help you win the jackpot.

## The rules

* Microverse contains 37 worlds
* Every world is always for sale
* At the start of the simulation, worlds are unowned, and are sold via an hour long dutch auction where the price slowly declines towards zero until the world is sold
* Owners can change the price of their worlds, but have to pay a 10% tax on the difference between the current price and a higher price (no tax for decreasing the price). To decrease the price, users pay a flat 0.01 ETH fee (this is simply to prevent spam)
* All transactions in Microverse go directly through the Microverse economy (see figure below for the exact splits), with roughly half going towards the stimulus (jackpot) and the other half going instantly to the owners of worlds
* As soon as the first world is sold, a 24 hour countdown begins. When the countdown reaches zero, the simulation ends and the stimulus is distributed
* Each time a world is purchased or the price is changed the timer goes up 30 seconds to a maximum of 24 hours. 
* At the end of the simulation, the player who owns the world that is least powerful compared to its neighbors (lowest market price compared to the average of all its neighbors) wins half of the stimulus. The rest is distributed proportionally to the next least powerful worlds. 

### Microverse economy splits

Every ETH that flows through the Microverse economy is allocated as follows:

* 45% to the stimulus
* 40% to current owners of worlds
* 5% to the referrer
* 5% to seed the stimulus of the next simulation
* 5% to developers

### Stimulus splits

At the end of a simulation, 45% of the stimulus is sent directly to the owner of the world least powerful relative to its neighbors and 5% is sent to the Microverse community fund. 

The remaining 50% is distributed as follows:
* 40% to the owners of worlds, sorted by least powerful relative to its neighbors
* 10% to seed the next round 

### Microverse community fund

The Microverse community fund covers the costs of development and rewards contributions to the Microverse ecosystem. If you do awesome things like translate the game to other languages or something else that helps Microverse grow, you might get your address added to the payroll.
